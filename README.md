# hello-world
This is my first repository (after I screwed up on the first two attempts).

Most of the stuff I have learned in life is because I was impatient. I balanced how long it would take for someone that "knew what they were doing" versus how long it would take me to figure it out myself. Often times, the latter was the quicker path and it has taught me a lot.  I like being able to fix things on my own, and with most things, I can, but I've so far been pretty limited in my abilities when it comes to software. Hopefully I can change that.
